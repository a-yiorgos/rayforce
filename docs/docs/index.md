- :fontawesome-solid-feather-pointed:{ .lg .middle } __Simple LISP-like syntax__

    ---

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Syntax](content/syntax.md)

- :material-poll:{ .lg .middle } __Columnar storage__

    ---

    The columnar storage is a great way to optimize the storage and speed up the queries
    due to heavy usage of the vectorized operations.

- :material-language-c:{ .lg .middle } __Plain C__

    ---

    RayforceDB is written in plain C with no dependencies,
    which makes it easy to integrate and maintain. As a bonus, it's very compact (less 1Mb) to fit directly into CPU cache.

- :material-scale-balance:{ .lg .middle } __Open Source, MIT__
